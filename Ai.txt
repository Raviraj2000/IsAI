The night was always the hardest for Maria. Every evening, as the sun set and the stars came out, she felt a deep sense of loneliness. She lived in a small cabin in the woods, far from any other people, and the stillness of the night only amplified her solitude.
But tonight was different. As she sat by the fire, she heard a strange noise outside. It was a soft rustling, like leaves in the wind, but there was no wind tonight. Maria cautiously made her way to the door, peering out into the darkness.
There, in the moonlight, she saw a figure moving towards her. It was a man, unlike any she had ever seen before. He was tall and regal, with piercing blue eyes that seemed to glow in the dark. He walked with a grace and confidence that was both intimidating and intriguing.
"Who are you?" Maria asked, her voice shaking with fear and excitement.
"I am the Night," the man replied, his voice deep and echoing. "And I have come to keep you company."
Maria was frightened, but she felt a strange pull towards the man. They sat by the fire and talked for hours, about everything and nothing at all. Maria felt a sense of peace she had never known before, as if the Night's presence was chasing away the loneliness she had always felt.
And as the night slowly turned to dawn, Maria realized that the Night would be back again the next evening, and every evening after that. She would never be alone in the dark again.
From that night on, the Night came to Maria every evening, and they talked and laughed until the sun rose. And even though she never saw him during the day, Maria knew that the Night was always there, watching over her, comforting her, and keeping her company through the long, dark nights.
